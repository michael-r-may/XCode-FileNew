With that in mind, I wanted to start thinking about what I've learned along the way that might inform my choices this time, as well as source the same kind of knowledge from the community. \r\n\r\nTo my suprise no document seemed to exist that distilled any of this kind of knowledge (I may well be wrong, I didn't search all that hard) and so I decided to make this and see what happens next.\r\n\r\nI will begin putting my own thoughts in here, but if you find it useful, or disagree, or see something you cannot believe I missed out, pull requests are very welcome.\r\n\r\nAnd so, without further ado..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
