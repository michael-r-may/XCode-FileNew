# Xcode-FileNew
Considerations, suggestions and recommendations for when starting a new iOS project

## Why
Very soon I will be starting a new job, with a brand new app. So, for the first time in years I will be hitting the hallowed menu option ```File > New``` in Xcode. With that in mind, I wanted to start thinking about what I've learned along the way that might inform my choices this time, as well as source the same kind of knowledge from the community. 

To my suprise no document seemed to exist that distilled any of this kind of knowledge (I may well be wrong, I didn't search all that hard) and so I decided to make this and see what happens next.

I will begin putting my own thoughts in here, but if you find it useful, or disagree, or see something you cannot believe I missed out, pull requests are very welcome.

And so, without further ado..let us begin

## Project or Workspace?
A workspace, containing the new project, is often a better choice if you think you will be using CocoaPods or have other dependencies that you would like to contain within Xcode Project Navigator and build alongside the main project.
